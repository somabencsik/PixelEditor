# What it is?

This project started beacause I wanted a dead simple sprite creator for free.<br>
All it does that it creates a MxM "tile-map" which can be filled with colors and later export it.

# Dependencies

python3>=3.10<br>
pygame==2.5.2<br>
pygame-widgets==1.1.5<br>

# What can it do?

- Draw 64x64 (that works for sure) surface to draw
- Change color with RGB values with slider and input

# What will it do?

Kind of in a priority order.

- Have a color picker
- Eraser
- Export as image
- Be able to use more sizes (32x32, 128x128, (...)?)
- Set alpha value as well
- Zoom in-out
